# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction Dashboard (Streamlit + Machine Learning)

This project is an interactive **Streamlit dashboard** that predicts wine quality scores (0–10) based on physicochemical properties of wine.  

### 🔑 Key Highlights
- **Dataset**: `winequalityN.csv` (red & white wines).
- **Features**: Alcohol, pH, sulphates, citric acid, volatile acidity, etc.
- **Model**: RandomForestRegressor (scikit-learn).
- **Evaluation**: Mean Squared Error (MSE) & R² Score.
- **Dashboard Features**:
  - Dataset preview 📊
  - Model performance metrics ⚙️
  - Visualizations (histograms & scatter plots) 🎨
  - Prediction UI for custom wine inputs 🔮
- **Design Enhancements**: Attractive background, glass-style cards, sidebar navigation, compact graphs in tabs.
